                <p>
                    1. NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment. It's actually helps JavaScript to run outside of server. It's used in server side development. <br />
                    MongoDB is NoSQL database which is document oriented. It represents data as of JSON documents. It's used for store data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language. There are other similar tools for other languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, etc...
                    So, if you want to write some kind of stand-alone program or server in Javascript, then you can use nodejs for it. <br />

                    If your application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would typically use some form of database. There are dozens of popular databases. MongoDB is one such database. MariaDB, MySql, CouchDB, DynamoDB (on AWS), Postgres are examples of other databases. Different databases have different strengths (things they are best at) and different ways of using them so it's a whole different question to choose the right/best database for what you're doing.

                <p>
                    JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. <br />
                    <span className='text-decoration-underline'>How Does work?</span>
                    <p>
                        JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted. <br />
                        A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
